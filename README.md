# "80's as code"

BlueStepper is a simple PowerShell based 16th note [Step Sequencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer) which allows for definition of the note sequence and tempo through PowerShell to sequence external Midi devices

Each "Step" is simply an element in a PowerShell [Hasthtable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.hashtable?view=netframework-4.8) that is populated with strings indicating which Note should be played, at which velocity, and for how long.

This module uses [Psychlist1972's PowerShell MIDI Module](https://github.com/Psychlist1972/Windows-10-PowerShell-MIDI) for all MIDI Operations, which uses the [multi-client MIDI API for Windows 10](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/09/21/midi-enhancements-in-windows-10/). Therefore BlueStepper is **only compatible with Windows 10**.

In **Play mode**, the hashtable patterns are iterated through in time to the set [BPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo) of the sequencer, playing the notes defined in the patterns. The time it takes PowerShell to trigger each note during step playback is measured and subtracted from the total step time to attempt to keep timing.

Typically it takes less than 1ms to perform a note operation, but with sequencing average time is about 1ms or less to send a Drum and two intrsument notes on the same step. This leaves over a 100ms idle wait time in a 120BPM 16th step and sounds alright! Currently random Random SlowDowns in the 5-10ms seem to happen once ever few hundred steps but seem to be PowerShell related. Overall the timekeeping is unquestionably not a professional grade, but serviceable for having fun!

The primary use case for BlueStepper is to use it with a USB Midi Interface to send notes to Drum Machines, Synthesizers, or any other device with a MIDI input.

It's very simple and quite "PowerShell'ey" - This was never meant to be the "BE ALL END ALL" step sequencer, but it can do some pretty cool things and sounds pretty good! *80's as code*üéπ

# Features
* Simple and very PowerShell friendly - make some cool beats and learn PowerShell at the same time!
* Program 3 different instruments patterns with "infinite" number of steps in a pattern
* Select Individual  Patterns to play or Sequence a variety of patterns into "Songs"
* Adjustable BPM
* Helper Functions to make writing music sequences easy:
    * Translation of Note to MIDI note number
    * Easy setup / and helpers for Synthesizers, Drum Machines
* "Pretty Good" timekeeping... for PowerShell anyways üòä
* Debug Output! 

# Todo 
* Better Performance - Especially for Stop-Notes
* Midi CLock - Even if it's not perfect a slight drifting clock control to control multiple devices could still be useful!
* Arpeggiator

# Demos
Here are some classics with some parts that have been sequenced from scratch using BlueStepper and played on real synthesizers

    1 = ($DrumIntro)
    17 = ($DrumMain,$BassPattern1)

# DrumSequence 2 will start to play on Step 17 (replacing DrumSequence 1)
# Bass Pattern 1 will also start to play on Step 17
